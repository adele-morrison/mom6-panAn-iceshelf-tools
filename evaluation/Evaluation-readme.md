# Evaluation hackathon

Instructions:

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Make a new branch with your name `git checkout -b <yourname>` i.e. for CLaire it's `git checkout -b <yourname>`
3. `cd` into `evaluation` and make a new folder with your diagnostic.
4. Copy the example notebook, and start hacking away (you will need to be on a recent conda analysis xp65 env, recommend `analysis3-25.07`)
5. When ready to upload, do `git add <path to your notebook>`, `git commit -m "A helpful message"` and `git push -u <yourname> <yourname>` (which sets the upstream branch to also be your name, i.e. for me it is `git push -u claire claire`)
6. Make a PR on github to merge it into main

(This assumes you have write access to the repo, if you don't you'll need to replace step 1 with make a fork of this repo, clone the fork locally, and then repeat as above)

Feel free to post plots by making a new issue and adding the `evaluation` tag to it.

You may need special access to open the data (something went weird with permissions) - contact Claire if you have problems.
